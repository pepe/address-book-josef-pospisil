- Ruby & Rails on Ubuntu is not that straightforward
- RoR needs webpacker needs node needs yarn
- hello port 3000, long time no see.

- postgres needs -all on ubuntu for gem compiling
- `-` is not symbol character in ruby :-D
- nested resources are complex
- 2>/dev/null for the test deprecation
- webpack is slow
